## üîç Overview

This repository presents the first part of my **Computer Vision Master's thesis project**: a pipeline to annotate the [CMU Panoptic Studio dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hanbyulj/panoptic-studio/) with accurate 3D facial reconstructions from multiview images. Using [DAD-3DNet](https://github.com/PinataFarms/DAD-3DHeads) for 3D landmark detection, Bundle Adjustment Structure (BAS) via [CvSBA](https://github.com/willdzeng/cvsba) for 3D refinement and a customed **RANSAC** method for view selection. The approach achieves low reprojection error and generates a refined 3D facial dataset aligned with the original images.

The reconstructions With the execution of this code you will get refined 3D annotations that could be used

## üìÑ Dataset 

The dataset used for this code is extracted from [CMU Panoptic Studio](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hanbyulj/panoptic-studio/). There were selected a group of sequences that are saved inside [sequence folder](https://github.com/EstherRobotics/TFM_Multiview_3D_Reconstruction/tree/main/src/panoptic_reconstruction/data/sequences) in data. These images were used for the developing and evaluation of the program and can be used to execute the [main](https://github.com/EstherRobotics/TFM_Multiview_3D_Reconstruction/blob/main/src/panoptic_reconstruction/__main__.py) code directly. 

For executing the [from_txt](https://github.com/EstherRobotics/TFM_Multiview_3D_Reconstruction/blob/main/src/panoptic_reconstruction/from_txt.py) code, you should download the sequences corresponding to the paths inside [files](https://github.com/EstherRobotics/TFM_Multiview_3D_Reconstruction/tree/main/src/panoptic_reconstruction/data/files) folder. 


## üíª Requirements

- Create a new python environment
- Install the dependencies contained in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/EstherRobotics/TFM_Multiview_3D_Reconstruction/blob/main/requirements.txt)
- Make sure that your system support C++ compilation for csvba execution. 



## ‚öôÔ∏è Parameters

The management of routes is define inside [config folder](https://github.com/EstherRobotics/TFM_Multiview_3D_Reconstruction/tree/main/src/panoptic_reconstruction/config). Inside confing.ymal is defined: 
- *save_cropped_imgs*: Folder name to save [facial crops](https://github.com/EstherRobotics/TFM_Multiview_3D_Reconstruction/tree/main/src/panoptic_reconstruction/data/cropped_imgs_for_evaluation) used facial landmark detection is performed.
- *annotations*: Folder name to save [annotations](https://github.com/EstherRobotics/TFM_Multiview_3D_Reconstruction/tree/main/src/panoptic_reconstruction/data/annotations) inside data folder.
- *seq_names*: Name of the sequences to process by the main, that are saved in [sequence folder](https://github.com/EstherRobotics/TFM_Multiview_3D_Reconstruction/tree/main/src/panoptic_reconstruction/data/sequences). 

Feel free to adjust this information and manage_paths routes as convenience. 

## üöÄ Usage

After installation of the environment, you should configure the program environment using: 

pip install -e . 

Then, to execute the main code just co to TFM_Multiview_3D_Reconstruction path and execute: 

python -m panoptic_reconstruction 


This will start the code which will follow the next pipeline automatically: 


....


If you want to use files with paths definition for the selected sequences, you can use the from_txt code by typing: 

python -m panoptic_reconstruction.from_txt <method>

Where method can be: train, vlaid or test. In this case, will select one of the three [files](https://github.com/EstherRobotics/TFM_Multiview_3D_Reconstruction/tree/main/src/panoptic_reconstruction/data/files) defined. 



## üìä Results

As a result, you will obtain three outcomes: 

- *3D_annotations*: 3D reconstruciton annotations
- *reprojections*: 2D reprojected landmarks in coordinates scaled to the facial crops. 
- *nsreprojections*: 2D reprojected landmarks with the coordinates following the hdImgs original size from sequences. 

Esentially, both reprojections 2D coordinates are the same but they are saved in different coordinates for covinience. 


This information can be used for reconstruct the 3D mesh of the faces detected:
