# TFM_Multiview_3D_Reconstruction
This repository contains the first part of my Computer Vision Master's thesis: a pipeline to annotate the CMU Panoptic Studio dataset with accurate 3D facial reconstructions using multiview images, DAD-3DNet for landmark detection, and a RANSAC-based view selection method.
